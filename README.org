#+title: org-assistant

/still under construction. Any help would be appreciated!/

org-assistant is a tool to help you build your org-agenda dynamically. It takes the events for each day, aswell as their category, generates a timeline and them implements that into your org agenda.

* How does it work?
The algorithm prompts the user for events which he must accomplish during the day (trying to add the ability to read org agenda).
Once it has all the data, it generates a timeline for the day.
The beauty of it is that any event for which you do not have a set time, will be assigned a time to fit into your schedule.


* PS
/first time making something in lisp so please have patience with some atrocities in the code/

* What's left?
** TODO export final agenda-string to a file
** TODO Read events from org-agenda
** TODO Make into an official package
** TODO Improve variable naming
** TODO read-character for decisions
