* How should it work
1. User creates a list of events and gives each event a time and duration, both can be wild-cards.
2. Algorithm creates time-line
   1. Starts at first event
   2. All time-specific events are assigned
   3. All non-time-specific events (wild-card times) are evenly distributed
   4. Schedule is checked if it makes sense
